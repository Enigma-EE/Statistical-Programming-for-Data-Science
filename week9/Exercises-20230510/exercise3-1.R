# Exercises for dplyr  ---------------------------------------------------------
# Vectorisation, apply() function, data manipulations


# Please try to complete tasks listed below. Type your code and results 
# interpretations in each section.


# clean up global environment
rm(list = ls())

# load the library
library(dplyr)


### Task 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Load data set "admissions" from the package "dslabs" (you might need to
# install the package first). Check the data set, check the help file for the 
# data. Use apply function to get type of data for each variable.
# Provide your comment about the data.





### Task 2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Use apply functions and "dplyr" package functionality to get average values
# for a number of applicants and percent of students admitted.
# Provide 3-4 different versions of the code.





### Task 3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Use "base" and "dplyr" functionality to get average values for a number of 
# applicants and percent of students admitted for "men" only.
# Provide 3-4 different versions of the code.





### Task 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Create two data frames based on the original one. First data set is to have
# columns "major", "gender" and "admitted". Second data set is to have columns
# "major", "gender" and "applicants". 

# Use "base" and "dplyr" functionality to combine these two data sets together.
# Provide 3-4 different versions of the code for combining data.

# Check if you get the same result as the original data set.
