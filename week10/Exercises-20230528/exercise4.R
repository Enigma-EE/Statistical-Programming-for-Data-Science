# Exercises for lecture 4 ------------------------------------------------------
# Advanced data visualisation


# Please try to complete tasks listed below. Type your code and results 
# interpretations in each section.


# clean up global environment
rm(list = ls())


### Task 1 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Load data set "movielens" from the package "dslabs". Check data description.
# extract only ratings for my favorite movies listed below and make a graph
# of boxplots with ratings distribution. Comment on the distribution.

best.movies <- c("Back to the Future", 
                 "Back to the Future Part II",                                                
                 "Back to the Future Part III")






### Task 2 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Count how many times a rating of each value was awarded to each of my 
# favourite movies and build percent stacked barchart. 
# It is a graph of bars corresponding to rating values (from 0.5 to 5 with 
# 0.5 step). Each bar has the same height as it represents 100% and coloured 
# areas inside the bar show proportions of ratings for each of three movies.






### Task 3 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Adjust the graph in task 2 to get proportional stacked area chart. That is,
# not bars but lines, however stacked and stretched to 100% as above.






### Task 4 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# For the "movielens" data set creates a line chart showing the history of
# how many movies were released per year. Add a vertical line to identify
# a year with maximal number of movies.






### Task 5 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

# Check Ggplot2 gallery - https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/index.html
# and try to create as many different graphs as possible.
