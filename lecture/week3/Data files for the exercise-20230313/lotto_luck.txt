Lotto luck has struck twice in WA with two winners taking home $608,243 each in Saturday night's draw.  The winning tickets were sold at The Lucky Charm Ellenbrook and Causeway Newsagency in Victoria Park. For each of the outlets, it was the second Division 1 Lotto ticket they'd sold.  Causeway Newsagency owner Than Phan said he had been running his outlet for more than 10 years and it had been a long time since he had last sold a Division 1 winner.
"We think it might be our new location that has bought us luck," he said."We moved here two years ago and we have all been saying we need a big win to put us on the map. Now we're on it."Jackie Morabito from The Lucky Charm said word of their Division 1 Lotto win was spreading very quickly around Ellenbrook.  Lotterywest is still waiting to hear from WA's newest Division 1 Lotto winners.
